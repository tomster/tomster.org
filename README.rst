This project builds and contains my personal website at `http://tomster.org/ <http://tomster.org/>`_.

It's only here on github for my own convenience and perhaps for the benefit of people who would like to build something similar.

It currently uses:

* a `yeoman <http://yeoman.io>`_ based site structure (built with `generator-webapp <https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp>`_)
* a (S)CSS layout based on `ZURB Foundaiton <http://foundation.zurb.com>`_.
* a deploy process using `ansible <http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/>`_.

If any of the above tickles you, take a peek and feel free to ask questions or – even better – point out stuff I could do better :)
