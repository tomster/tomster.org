After a multi-year hiatus, I'm back to blogging.

Why? Well, for starters, there's only so much you can `fit into 140 characters <http://twitter.com/tomlazar>`_. But more importantly, I've found that I owe a great deal of my professional development during that period to other geeks who took the time to write down their experiences. Sure, there's always the official documentation and stackoverflow in any given field, but without geeks who share their successes and failures on their personal blogs (and Google, that let's me find them!), I doubt I'd be at the level of prowess that I enjoy today. Seriously.

So, I've increasingly felt that I'm cheating, by only benefiting from others, without giving anything back. Until last week the level of guilt finally superseded my own laziness and I set out to build myself a blog, the result of which you can see here.

At this point there's obviously no useful content yet, just the bare skeleton and this lonely first entry. But by publishing this state I hope to trick myself into following up with some actual content.
