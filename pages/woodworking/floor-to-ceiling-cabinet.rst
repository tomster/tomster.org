Three things motivated me for this project: firstly I had finally saved enough money to get my first proper power tools, secondly we had this really inconvenient corner in our bathroom that just begged for a custom solution and thirdly, a project that mainly consisted of setting up a simple structure onto which you slapped some standard particle board seemed like a good first project.
